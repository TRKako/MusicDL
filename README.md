# MusicDL
software I made so my aunt can use her mp3 without any problems

## Requirements
- `node v18.20.5` you can find it **[here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.20.5/)**

or you can straight up directly download it by [pressing here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.20.5/node-v18.20.5-x64.msi) (the `windows x64 msi` btw)

## note
This program relies on msedge.exe, "`C:\`" directory, and the msedge rute on windows to work, I would be happy to do some linux support, but unfortunately I don't have Linux and I don't know how it works at all
